      <h2>Sites of New World Publishing, 1535-1800</h2>
      <p>This map shows the location of printing presses in the Americas from 1535 to 1800 and gives a rough visual estimate of each location's published output.  Data provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://library.brown.edu/">The Brown University Library</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/">The John Carter Brown Library</a>.</p>
      <p>Mouse over a circle to see the full name of the place and the total number of works published there.  For the smallest circules, placing your cursor just above the top of the circle works best.</p>
      <p><span class="notebene">Note on visualization:</span> Circles are drawn in descending order of size to ensure that larger publishing centers do not 'obliterate' smaller ones.  However, the temporal aspect of this vizualization <em>has no relation to chronological time</em>.</p>
      <p>Built with the <a target="_blank" href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> javascript library </p>

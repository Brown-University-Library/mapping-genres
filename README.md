#Mapping-Genres

This code runs the [_Mapping Colonial Americas Publishing Project_](http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/mapping-genres/).  It is a basic HTML website with visualizations created in the [D3.js](http://www.d3js.org) library.  The code has no dependencies, and as of the last commit, all links out to external libraries are still functioning.

This repository also contains scripts for data munging and the data files used in the visualizations.  The /data folder also contains test data and mid-stage files from the data munging process.

_Mapping Colonial Americans Publishing Project_ is a collaboration between [Jim Egan](http://research.brown.edu/myresearch/James_Egan) and [Jean Bauer](http://www.jeanbauer.com) through the Brown University Library's [Center for Digital Scholarship](http://library.brown.edu/cds).  Additional programming by Dan Shiebler.  If you want to contribute data or plan to use the site in your classes, [please let us know](mailto:jean_bauer@brown.edu)!

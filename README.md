#Mapping-Genres

This code runs the [_Mapping Colonial Americas Publishing Project_](http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/mapping-genres/).  It is a basic HTML website with visualizations created in the [D3.js](http://www.d3js.org) library.  The code has no dependencies, and as of the last commit, all links out to external libraries are still functioning.

_Mapping Colonial Americans Publishing Project_ is a collaboration between [Jim Egan](http://research.brown.edu/myresearch/James_Egan) and [Jean Bauer](http://www.jeanbauer.com) through the Brown University Library's [Center for Digital Scholarship](http://library.brown.edu/cds).  If you want to contribute data or plan to use the site in your classes, [please let us know](mailto:jean_bauer@brown.edu)!
